        <!-- We need to add the CSRF or cross-site request forgery token.
This token is a randomly generated unique value which will be added
to the form as a hidden input field when the forms submitted.
And works to guarantee that the data we're posting is actually coming from our
todo list app and not from another website.
If we were to skip adding this token.
Django would throw an error when we submitted the form because it wouldn't
be able to guarantee that the post data wasn't coming from another site.
